# Swapping-two-values
## AIM:
To write a python program for swapping of two values
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable 
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.
### Step 4:  
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: 
End the program
## PROGRAM:
```
#Program for swapping two values
#Developed by Kishore B
#Register number : 23013723

n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())

temp = n1
n1 = n2
n2 = temp

print(f"The swapped values are {n1} and {n2})
```
